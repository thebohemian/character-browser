Character Browser Demonstration
-------------------------------

Uses Rick And Morty GraphQL API to retrieve character data and display them using Android Jetpack Compose.

Other noteworthy APIs:
- Dagger2 + Hilt
- Coil
- Apollo
- MockK
- kotest
- Turbine
- paparazzi
- Robolectric

Focus of this example is unit testability. There are three types of unit tests:
 - logic tests of non-UI code
 - logic tests of own composables (eg. click results in call of specific listener)
 - snapshot test of own composables
